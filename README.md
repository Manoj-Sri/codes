THESE ARE MY OWN  CODES FOR FEW STANDARD DS ALGOS QUESTIONS FROM GEEKS FOR GEEKS


1)BINARY SEARCH
1)Simple Binary Search

2)Search an element in a sorted and rotated array

3)Check for Majority Element in a sorted array

4)Ceiling in a sorted array

5)ind the Minimum length Unsorted Subarray, sorting which makes the complete array sorted

6)Count number of occurrences (or frequency) in a sorted array

7)Find a Fixed Point (Value equal to index) in a given array

8)Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing

9)Merge an array of size n into another array of size m+n

10)Median of two sorted arrays of same size

11)Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array


DIVIDE AND CONQUER TECHNIQUE(dc)

1)Write a program to calculate pow(x,n)

2)Closest Pair of Points using Divide and Conquer algorithm(*******NOTYETDONE*******)

3)Maximum Sub array sum

4)Fibonacci using d and c

TREES (better to do them on online judge of gfg)

1)size of the tree

2)depth of a tree

3)dimeter of atree

4)count no of leaves

5)check for height balanced tree or not

6)max width of a tree

7)level order traversal

8)reverse level order traversal

9)Spiral level order traversal(not yet done the optimised method)

10)check if two trees are identical or not
